# Python-Challenge

## Py Bank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* The challenge in this task was to create a Python script for analyzing the [financial records csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv)

* The Python script that was used to analyze the data contained each of the following:

    * The total number of months in the dataset 

    * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period 

    * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 

    * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

    * The Financial Analysis was then printed to the terminal and exported as a text file. 

## PyPoll 

![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* In this Python Script we will be analyzing [voting data](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv) which will contain each of the following:

    * The total number of votes cast

    * A complete list of candidates who received votes 

    * The percentage of votes each candidate won 

    * The total number of votes each candidate won

    * The winner of the election based on popular vote 

    * The final script printed the analysis both to the terminal and exported a text file with the results
